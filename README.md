guide and docs for my Arch Linux + Hyprland setup

## notes
- these docs are focused on the desktop environment rather than the whole installation process. details such as system partitioning, bootloader installation, etc. are **outside the scope.**
- this is **not** a full-fledged guide on how to install Arch Linux and Hyprland. it is assumed you know what you are doing, and **you should always refer to the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page) and [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hypr.land/).**
- as always, **you are the only one responsible for any changes made to your system.**

## contributing

contributions should stay limited to improving the existing documentation without deviating from the original, intended setup.

if you intend to commit larger changes that alter the current setup, consider forking instead.
