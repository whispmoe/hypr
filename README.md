guide and docs for my Arch Linux + Hyprland setup

## notes
- these docs are focused on the desktop enviroment rather than the whole installation process. details such as system partitioning, bootloader installation, etc. are **outside the scope**.
- this is **not** a full-fledged guide on how to install Arch Linux and Hyprland. it is assumed you know what you are doing, and **you should always refer to the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page) and [Hyprland Wiki](https://wiki.hypr.land/).**
- as always, **you are the one and only responsible for any changes made to your system.**
