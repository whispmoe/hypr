# hyprdocs
personal docs for my Arch Linux + Hyprland setup

## contents
- **[packages](/docs/packages.md)** - breakdown of packages used and their purpose.
- **[applications](/docs/applications.md)** - breakdown of more general purpose applications used, including flatpaks.

## notes
- throughout these docs, it is assumed you already have basic (arch) linux knowledge.
- these docs are focused on the desktop environment rather than the whole installation process. details such as system partitioning, bootloader installation, etc. are **outside the scope.**
- as always, **you are the only one responsible for any changes made to your system.**
